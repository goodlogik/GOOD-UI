# DC-UI

DC-UI makes it easy to create custom ruby functions to render markup elements.
It is loosly coupled with [Semantic UI](http://www.semantic-ui.com) and 
adds some framework specific options to make front-end development a little easier.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dc_ui'
```

Copy the initializer and the default markup elements.

```bash
rake dc_ui:setup
```

## Usage
