Build rich UIs with ease by combining the powers of Ruby, Slim and Meta-programming.

## What
```slim

= container 'fluid'
  = grid 'celled'
     = row
      = column size: 16
        = segment 'inverted'
          = h2 'inverted'
            = icon 'checkmark'
            | Its easy
    = row
      = column computer: 8, tablet: 10, mobile: 16
        = segment 'green'
          p first paragraph
    = row
      = column size: 16, only: :computer
        = segment 'secondary'
          = h1, class: 'dividing', text: 'Big Header'
          p second paragraph
```

## Why
- Because clean and redable code reduces cognitire load and speeds up development.
- Unlike css classes, misspelled functions throw errors, drastically reducing the debug time.

## Also
- First class integrations with Semantic UI and Vue.js

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'goodui'
```

And run 

```bash
rake goodui:setup
```

This copies the initializer and a markup configuration file **markup.yml** with defaults for Semantic UI.

## Reads Like
```slim

= container
  = grid
    = column computer: 8, tablet: 10, mobile: 16
      = segment class: 'green'
        p first paragraph
    = column size: 16, only: :computer
      = segment class: 'secondary'
        = header tag: :h1, class: 'dividing', text: 'Big Header'
        p second paragraph
```

## How it works

The ui.yml file contains a list of all the UI elements along with their tags and default css classes.

```yaml
container:
  tag: div
  css_class: 'container'
grid:
  tag: div
  css_class: 'grid'

column:
  tag: div
  css_class: 'wide column'
```

The ui elements can be accessed in views by calling them as a function

```slim
= grid
```

The will produce

```html
<div class="ui grid"></div>
```

Notice that the semantic-ui class **ui** class was automatically added. This behavior can be disabled by 
setting **ui** property to false

```yaml
grid:
  tag: div
  css_class: 'grid'
  ui: off
```

The same functionl call 

```slim
= grid
```

will now produce

```html
<div class="grid"></div>
```

### Semantic UI Integration

You can specify column size

```slim
= column size: 8
```

This will produce

```html
<div class="eight wide column"></div>
```

You can specify different sizes for **computer**, **tablet** and **mobile**.

```slim
= column computer: 8, tablet: 6, mobile: 16
```

Will produce

```html
<div class="eight wide computer ten wide tablet sixteen wide mobile wide column"></div>
```

You can make items only visible on **computer**, **tablet** and **mobile**.

```slim
= column only: :computer
```

Will produce

```html
<div class="computer only wide column"></div>
```

### Adding Elements
You can add your own elements by customizing ui.yml.

```yaml
hero:
  tag: div
  css_class: 'segment hero'
  ui: off
```

calling the element function

```slim
= hero
  h1 hello world
```

will produce

```html
<div class="segment hero"><h1>Hello World</h1></div>
```
